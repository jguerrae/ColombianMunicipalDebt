## Description
This repository contains the research "Staying in Power: How does political continuity influence local fiscal outcomes?" which explores the relationship between political continuity and fiscal outcomes at the local level in Colombia. Despite existing regulations, subnational debt in Colombia remains notably low compared to the central government's debt. This study aims to identify the reasons behind this phenomenon and establish how political cycles affect regional fiscal outcomes.

### Document Structure
The analysis employs a regression discontinuity design around profit and loss margins to isolate endogeneity between political cycles and debt. It considers a current variable defined as the margin of victory or loss of the political party in contemporary elections that won in the previous period. Results highlight that in municipalities where political parties manage to repeat, debt is significantly higher, evidencing a more pronounced relationship as the margin of victory increases.

### Methodology
The methodology focuses on a Kink regression discontinuity design, retrieving the effect of the repetition of a political election on debt. This allows for a detailed look at how political continuity influences debt management at the subnational level.
